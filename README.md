# McGillBillboardProjectVizualization

Wecome!

This is a small project designed to facilitate analysis on the [McGill-Billboard Corpus](https://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/The_McGill_Billboard_Project_(Chord_Analysis_Dataset)/). It contains a few components:
1. A group of python scripts to parse the information contained in the corpus into a more database friendly format
2. A set of database schema to contain the information produced by the scripts
3. A java class to make queries against the databases, and present the information to the user.

The individual Java and Python files are documented, this file contains some documentation about the database and a more general overview of the project.
